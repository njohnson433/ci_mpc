# Progress log

Running log of what has been done, what was found, and where to resume. Newest entry on top.
Read this before starting work (and before re-investigating something "new").

## Where to resume

- **Current task:** ROADMAP task 3 (MPC tracking mode in the controller). Task 4 (controller in Isaac)
  **passes**: `scripts/isaac/run_impedance_test.sh` → hold 0.1 mm / 0.0003 rad, reach 0.47 mm / 0.0000 rad,
  <1 cm in 1.47 s (2 of 2 runs). Tasks 1–2 done.
  With identified joint friction (now the default scene): hold 0.00 mm, reach **2.2 mm** / 0.0035 rad,
  <1 cm in 1.58 s (2 of 2 runs, deterministic).
- **Open follow-ups for task 4:** physics/control at 1 kHz (now 240 Hz); RTF is ~0.35 with the GPU shared;
  the ~2 mm friction offset does not converge out (integrator too weak?); friction compensation still off.
- **Code that is not in this repo:**
  - `~/franka_ros2_ws/src/cartesian_impedance_control` (upstream `LucasG2001/cartesian_impedance_control`,
    no push access). Our work is on local branch `isaac-sim-pinocchio` (2 commits on top of `main` f8d5fe2).
    Backup: `patches/cartesian_impedance_control_isaac-sim-pinocchio.patch`.
    Restore: `git checkout -b isaac-sim-pinocchio f8d5fe2 && git am < .../ci_mpc/patches/cartesian_impedance_control_isaac-sim-pinocchio.patch`
  - `~/franka_ros2_ws/src` (franka_ros2 `humble`): `franka_bringup/config/controllers.yaml` registers
    `cartesian_impedance_controller`. Backup: `patches/franka_ros2_humble_controllers_yaml.patch` (`git apply`).
  - Assets outside git: `/home/njohnson/ci_mpc_assets/fr3_scene.usd`, `fr3.urdf`. The scene needs
    `scripts/isaac/prepare_scene.py` (physx variant + joint armature); old copy `fr3_scene.usd.bak-20261022`.
- **Regenerate the controller patch after changes:**
  `cd ~/franka_ros2_ws/src/cartesian_impedance_control && git format-patch main..isaac-sim-pinocchio --stdout > ../ci_mpc/patches/cartesian_impedance_control_isaac-sim-pinocchio.patch`

## Log

### 2026-10-22 (later): identified joint friction in the sim
- User decision: use the **identified** friction (controller header `static_friction`, `coulomb_friction`,
  `beta`; upstream author's FR3), not Franka's URDF `<dynamics>` (`friction 0.2` for every joint = placeholder,
  units undocumented). Earlier claim "~1 Nm on joints 5 and 7" was wrong: identified j5 1.29, j7 0.53 Nm.
- `prepare_scene.py` applies `PhysxJointAxisAPI:angular`: staticFrictionEffort = static, dynamicFrictionEffort =
  Coulomb, viscousFrictionCoefficient = beta·π/180 (PhysX unit Nm·s/deg). Not representable, left out:
  `offset_friction` (asymmetric bias, j2 −0.70 Nm) and the LuGre states. `--no-friction` removes it.
  Scene backup before friction: `fr3_scene.usd.bak-armature`.
- Open-loop check, joint 7 at home: 0.30 / 0.45 Nm → no motion, 0.60 Nm → 0.144 rad/s after 0.5 s
  (hand calc with armature 0.206 kg m²: 0.157 minus viscous) → friction active and in the right units.
- Test (no friction compensation in the controller): hold 0.00 mm / 0.0000 rad (stiction), reach final
  **2.2 mm** / 0.0035 rad (was 0.47 mm frictionless), <1 cm in 1.58 s (was 1.47). The error creeps
  1.8 → 2.2 mm from t = 5 to 10 s instead of converging: the integral term does not beat stiction here.

### 2026-10-22 (later): task 4 passes, the fix was FR3 joint armature in the sim
- Ablation (single runs; hold rot drift / reach rot err / reach pos err):

  | scene | nullspace damping | hold rot | reach rot | reach pos | result |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | no armature | 0 | 0.72 rad | 0.70 rad | 1.1 mm | FAIL |
  | no armature | 0.3 | 0.50 | 0.33 | 1.9 | FAIL |
  | no armature | 1.0 | 0.21 | 0.38 | 2.3 | FAIL |
  | no armature | 3.0 | 1.94 | 0.015 | 1.4 | hold FAIL |
  | **armature** | **0** | **0.0003** | **0.0000** | **0.47** | **PASS** (3 of 3 runs) |
  | armature | 1.0 | 0.0002 | 0.0000 | 0.47 | PASS |

- **Mechanism:** joint 7 velocity reversed sign on 95–99 % of 240 Hz steps (period-2 chatter): the
  controller's rotational damping (`D(5,5) ≥ 2√K`) is explicit, and the bare hand's inertia about joint 7
  is a few 1e-3 kg m², so D·dt/I ≫ 2 → unstable; the ±2 Nm tool-z clamp turned that into a slow 0.2 Hz
  wander. The real FR3 has rotor inertia reflected through the gearbox. Armature = `motor_inertia ·
  gear_ratio²` from the URDF `<dynamics>` tags: 0.606 (j1–2), 0.462 (j3–4), 0.206 kg m² (j5–7). After:
  sign-flip rate 6 %, |q̇7| median 0.002 rad/s.
- Nullspace damping only reduced the elbow self-motion (j1 swing 2.05 → 0.28 rad) and did not fix the
  wrist; with armature it adds nothing measurable. Kept as a parameter (default 0), Isaac config = 0.
- Checked: sim kinematics = Pinocchio FK (0.02–0.04 mm, 0.000 rad at 5 random q), so no axis/frame bug.

### 2026-10-22 (later): controller runs in Isaac; position tracks, orientation drifts
- **Our plugin loads and runs in Isaac's bundled controller_manager** (no ABI problem). joint_state_broadcaster
  + cartesian_impedance_controller active, /joint_states at 4.2 ms (240 Hz), EE at home = (0.3069, 0, 0.4869).
- Three Isaac-side fixes were needed to get there (all in `scripts/isaac/`):
  1. **Controller Manager target must be `/fr3`, not the articulation root `fr3_link0`.** The URDF synthesizer
     (`isaacsim.ros2.control/urdf_synth.py`) collects joints under the target prim; our joints live in
     `/fr3/Physics`, so with `fr3_link0` the URDF had no arm joints → "None of requested interfaces exist".
  2. With `fr3_link0` as target the first `setup_cm` always failed ("did not match any articulations") and a
     retry succeeded; the ROS2ControlManager graph node latches the first failure until Stop→Play. We now call
     `Ros2ControlManager.setup()` directly with retries (`setup_controller_manager()`), graph = /clock only.
     With `/fr3` as target it succeeded on attempt 1.
  3. Play first, set home pose, then start the Controller Manager. `app.close()` can hang on RTX sync in
     headless mode → teardown + `os._exit`.
- **Result (runs 6, 7), nullspace damping 0:** reach position **0.2–0.5 mm** final error, <1 cm in 1.47 s.
  Orientation **fails**: hold rot drift 0.60 rad, reach rot err 0.17–1.12 rad.
- **Mechanism:** joint 7 wanders 0.9 rad (hold) / 2.7 rad (reach) at ~0.2 Hz, rotation error is purely about
  tool z; joints 1–3, 5 swing 1–2 rad during a 15 cm reach = undamped nullspace self-motion. The sim joints
  have zero damping/friction, the controller's nullspace term was commented out, and the tool-z torque is
  clamped to ±2 Nm, so it cannot hold the wrist once the self-motion couples in.
- Added controller param `nullspace_damping` (Nms/rad, default 0 = unchanged real-robot behavior),
  `(I − Jᵀ Jᵀ⁺)(−d·q̇)`; Isaac config sets it. Sweep 0 / 0.3 / 1 / 3 running.
- Also: zero-torque arm drifts before activation (q7 0.785 → 0.675 between home and activation).
- Tools: `check_impedance_tracking.py --dump x.npz`, `CONTROLLER_CONFIG=... run_impedance_test.sh`.

### 2026-10-22 (later): first full Isaac test run, scene had no physics
- Run 1 failed before the controller loaded: `ROS2ControlManager setup failed ... no ArticulationRootAPI
  prim under '/fr3/Geometry/base/fr3_link0'`, then `set_home_pose` crashed (prim path not found).
- **Cause:** `fr3_scene.usd` references `fr3/payloads/base.usda` and carries the `Physics` variant set
  (mujoco / none / physics / physx), but had **no variant selected**. So no physics payload was composed:
  no articulation root, no joints, no rigid bodies (`fr3_link0` was only an `over`).
- **Fix:** selected `Physics = physx` in the scene (backup: `fr3_scene.usd.bak-20261022`). Checked with pxr:
  articulation root at `/fr3/Geometry/base/fr3_link0`, joints 1–7 revolute, drive type `force` with
  stiffness/damping 0 (effort mode), maxForce 87, robot gravity off.
- `run_impedance_test.sh`: the checker now gets stopped if Isaac exits early (run 1 left it waiting forever).
- Isaac headless startup took ~500 s with the GPU shared with the YOLO jobs (94 % util, 5.9 GB free).
  The YOLO jobs stay running (user decision).

### 2026-10-22: Isaac end-to-end test (task 4), in progress
- Added a headless test: `scripts/isaac/run_impedance_test.sh` starts Isaac (`headless_impedance_sim.py`,
  clean `env -i`, `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42`) and the ROS-side checker `scripts/check_impedance_tracking.py`
  (hold 3 s within 5 mm, then reach target within 1 cm / 0.05 rad in 10 s). The two sides sync through
  files in a temp dir. `scripts/isaac/add_ros2_control_graph.py` builds the Action Graph
  (`On Playback Tick → ROS2ControlManager` + `ROS2 Publish Clock`); also usable from the Script Editor.
- `scripts/isaac_ros.sh` now exposes the workspace plugins: `AMENT_PREFIX_PATH` = workspace + `/opt/ros/humble`,
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` = Isaac's bundled Humble libs first, then workspace, then `/opt/ros/humble/lib`.
  `--python script.py` runs a SimulationApp script in the same environment.
- Isaac bundles its own `controller_manager`, `hardware_interface`, `controller_interface`, `rclcpp`, so our
  plugin runs against those, not apt's. ABI mismatch is still the main open risk.
- First run (previous session) was cut off when the session ended, ~12 s into Isaac startup. No result.
- Note: the GPU is shared with the `ski_detection` YOLO training (~8.8 GB + 1.4 GB of 16 GB).

### 2026-10-22: Pinocchio model source (task 2), done
- Branch `isaac-sim-pinocchio` of `cartesian_impedance_control`: `PinocchioModel` (pimpl), params
  `model_source` (franka | pinocchio), `urdf_path`, `ee_frame`, `arm_id`, `enable_input_server`;
  rate-independent timing (integrator `* dt_`, filter `1-(1-a)^(dt/1ms)`, torque-rate limit scaled).
  Configs `config/isaac_sim_controllers.yaml` (240 Hz, pinocchio) and `config/real_robot_controllers.yaml`.
- Sanity check `pinocchio_model_check`: home TCP = (0.3069, 0, 0.4869), matches libfranka.
- **Bug found:** libfranka embeds its own Pinocchio and exports template instances (`ModelTpl`, `DataTpl`)
  with a different layout. If libfranka is linked first, `PinocchioModel` binds to them and crashes in
  `Model::operator=` (`std::length_error: vector::reserve`). Fix: link Pinocchio 4 before libfranka
  (CMakeLists). Same Eigen 3.4.0 on both sides, so that was not the cause.
- libfranka's own Model expects an arm-only URDF (our `fr3.urdf` has finger joints).
- Regression on mock hardware (isolated `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`): update loop runs, effort ≈ 1e-14 Nm at rest,
  torques respond to a reference pose and stay bounded (clamps/anti-windup saturate since mock doesn't move).
  `model_source: franka` path unchanged.
